# Obesity-MSLT-BR
Multistate Life Table model for overweight and obesity in Brazil (2020-2030)
Firstly, de changes in BMI and consequently in the prevelence of overweight and obesity at baseline and in the counterfactual scenarios are estimated in "1 PrevalÃªncias excesso de peso e obesidade"
Second, the PIFs for CVD, cancers, diabetes, CKD and cirrhosis are calculated in "2 PIF detail"
Third, the actual lifetable estimations are done in "Outcomes detail"
Fourth, uncertainty intervals are estimated through Monte Carlo simulations in "Stochastic inputs and outputs", using the Ersatz add-on
Finally, the final estimates are displayed in "Summary final results detail"
